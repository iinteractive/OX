0.09  2012-12-03
      - fix handling of multiple routes with equivalent paths (but different
        validations)

0.08  2012-11-16
      - allow declaring nested routers as mounts
      - $r->uri_for("string") now is a shortcut for
        $r->uri_for({name => "string"});
      - ControllerAction and HTTPMethod route builders now also set up a
        default 'name' for routes

0.07  2012-11-14
      - actually, disable middleware in roles for now, because it's not clear
        that it actually makes sense
      - add 'wrap_if' keyword for Plack::Middleware::Conditional support
        (relates to wrap in the same way that enable_if relates to enable in
        Plack::Builder)

0.06  2012-11-13
      - implement roles. using OX::Role will now let you declare partial
        routers in your roles which will be merged into the main router when
        you apply them to an OX class.
      - also clean up some bugs in router inheritance
      - add 'literal' keyword, for declaring dependencies on literal values
      - add warning for declaring routes which will be shadowed by mounts

0.05  2012-10-15
      - OX::Request->mapping should return a hashref, not a hash (minor
        back-compat break)

0.04  2012-09-29
      - support streaming responses

0.03  2012-09-28
      - fix tests on windows (path issue)
      - fix Counter-Improved example not having uri_for available
        (yet_another_anonymo)

0.02  2012-09-27
      - bump required perl version to 5.10, because it fails weirdly on 5.8

0.01  2012-09-25
      - Initial release
