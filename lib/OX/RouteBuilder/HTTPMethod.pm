# ABSTRACT: OX::RouteBuilder which routes to a method in a controller based on the HTTP method

use Try::Tiny;

with 'OX::RouteBuilder';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp;
  use OX;

  has controller => (
      is  => 'ro',
      isa => 'MyApp::Controller',
  );

  router as {
      route '/' => 'controller';
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an L<OX::RouteBuilder> which allows to a controller class based on the
HTTP method used in the request. The C<action_spec> should be a string
corresponding to a service which provides a controller instance. When a request
is made for the given path, it will look in that class for a method which
corresponds to the lowercased version of the HTTP method used in the request
(for instance, C<get>, C<post>, etc). If no method is found, it will fall back
to looking for a method named C<any>. If that isn't found either, an error will
be raised.

C<action> will automatically be added to the route as a default, as well as
C<name> (which will be set to the same thing as C<action>).
