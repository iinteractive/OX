# ABSTRACT: OX::RouteBuilder which routes to an action method in a controller class

use Try::Tiny;

with 'OX::RouteBuilder';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp;
  use OX;

  has controller => (
      is  => 'ro',
      isa => 'MyApp::Controller',
  );

  router as {
      route '/' => 'controller.index';
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an L<OX::RouteBuilder> which routes to action methods on a controller
class. The C<action_spec> should be a string in the form
C<"$controller.$action">, where C<$controller> is the name of a service which
provides a controller instance, and C<$action> is the name of a method on that
class.

C<controller> and C<action> will also be automatically added as defaults for
the route, as well as C<name> (which will be set to C<"$controller.$action">.
